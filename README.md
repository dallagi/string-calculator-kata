# Before you start: 

* Try not to read ahead.
* Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.
* Make sure you only test for correct inputs. there is no need to test for invalid inputs for this kata

## Reminder: the three rules of TDD

* You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
* You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
* You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

# String Calculator

## Iteration 1

Create a simple String calculator with a method signature:

```python
def add(numbers: str) -> int
```

The method can take up to two numbers, separated by commas, and will return their sum. 

For example `""` or `"1"` or `"1,2"` as inputs.

(for an empty string it will return 0) 

Hints:

* Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to one and two numbers
* Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
* Remember to refactor after each passing test

## Iteration 2

Allow the `add` method to handle an unknown amount of numbers

## Iteration 3

Allow the `add` method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).

the following input is ok: `"1\n2,3"` (will equal 6)

the following input is NOT ok: `"1,\n"` (not need to prove it - just clarifying)

## Iteration 4

Support different delimiters

to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: `"//[delimiter]\n[numbersâ€¦]"` for example `"//;\n1;2"` should return three where the default delimiter is `";"`.

the first line is optional. all existing scenarios should still be supported

## Iteration 5

Calling `add` with a negative number will throw an exception `"negatives not allowed"` - and the negative that was passed. 

if there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message.

**STOP HERE if you are a beginner. Continue if you can finish the steps so far in less than 30 minutes.**

## Iteration 6

Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001 = 2

## Iteration 6

Delimiters can be of any length with the following format: `"//[delimiter]\n"` for example: `"//[***]\n1***2***3"` should return 6

## Iteration 7

Allow multiple delimiters like this: `"//[delim1][delim2]\n"` for example `"//[*][%]\n1*2%3"` should return 6.

## Iteration 8

make sure you can also handle multiple delimiters with length longer than one char
